/* 
   Dispatching events isn't as easy as you want it to be.

   While the Dispatcher object (below) is relatively simple, the ruleset
   that determines what to dispatch is a little more complex.

   In a simple case, a object registers for a simple event:

     global_dispatch.listen('page.tick', mytarget);

   When notify() is called with 'page.tick', the `mytarget` object has its
   `setState` method called with whatever arg is passed to the notify()
   method. When the number of 'parts' is equal, this comparison is simple
   the parts must match (or the search must be a '*').

   Thus, 'page.*' would match 'page.tick', but not 'otherthing.tick'.

   While this would be good enough for most cases, we want to avoid
   the following.

     // This is what we want to avoid.
     global_dispatch.listen_fn('user.*.info.id', (payload) => {
        console.log("The ID is: " + payload.info.id);
     });

     // dispatch our complex user object.
     global_dispatch.notify('user.123', {'info':{'id':1}});

     // dispatch a different piece of user data.
     // This would result in an error.
     global_dispatch.notify('user.123', {'other':{'stuff':1}});

   Instead, since we know the search path, we can dig into the payload
   object, and return only what the listener asked for.

   Thus, 

     // This is what we actually do.
     global_dispatch.listen_fn('user.*.info.id', (payload) => {
        console.log("The ID is " + payload.id);
     });

     // dispatch our complex user object, the above will be called.
     global_dispatch.notify('user.123', {'info':{'id':1}});

     // dispatch a different piece of user data.
     // This will not invoke the handler above, because the
     // route did not match. See `dispatch_object_to_target`
     global_dispatch.notify('user.123', {'other':{'stuff':1}});

   This avoids nasty bugs, and makes sure that your handlers
   only ever get the data they requested. Handlers can use * at the
   end of their match in order to get all the keys.

   Keep in mind this only works for events that are dictionaries
   or objects.
